This is a simple and easy to use contact form plugin, it let's you add a contact form on any content you like (post or page).

== Description ==

The plugin is quite easy to use and configure. It displays a basic contact form, with name, surname, email, subject and message fields. Once the form is submitted it sends these details to the predefined email address. 

It does not have a captcha field, instead it has the option to limit the form to the registered visitors.

It uses the jquery validation plugin for input validation [Jquery Validation](http://jqueryvalidation.org/)

For a more advanced contact form where you can customize the fields, use multiple email addresses, captcha and more, you can check our commercial module here:
